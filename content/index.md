# Gustav Kjærbye Bagger

I am a PhD candidate in number theory at UNSW Canberra. My research interests include cyclotomic fields, splitting behaviour of prime ideals across Galois extensions and Artin's primitive root conjecture. Previously, I have worked on problems related to finding primitive elements in subsets of finite fields and norm-Euclideanity in cyclic cubic extensions. Outside mathematics, I enjoy hiking, climbing, coding and boardgames.
